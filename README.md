Our dedicated team of professionals has conscientiously defined a set of research questions that will serve as the foundation for our investigation. The valuable insights derived from this research will subsequently be shared with our esteemed press department, who will have the responsibility of presenting the findings at an upcoming conference dedicated to this critical domain.

By embarking on this project, we aim to shed light on the availability of staple foods and its impact on the wider population. Our research questions have been carefully formulated to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape, thereby enabling policymakers, stakeholders, and the public to make informed decisions and implement targeted strategies to address any potential challenges or disparities.

Through rigorous analysis and data-driven methodologies, our analytical department is committed to delivering accurate and unbiased results that will serve as a valuable resource for both academic and practical purposes. We recognize the significance of this research in shaping public discourse, informing policy formulation, and ultimately striving towards ensuring an equitable standard of living for all individuals.

The collaboration between our analytical department and the press department is crucial, as it ensures that the outcomes of our research reach a wider audience, including policymakers, experts, and the general public. We are confident that by disseminating our findings at the upcoming conference, we will facilitate meaningful discussions and inspire collective action to address any issues pertaining to the availability of staple foods.

In summary, this project represents a collaborative effort within our independent company, combining the expertise of our analytical department with the communication prowess of the press department. By seeking to answer the defined research questions, we endeavor to contribute to the ongoing discourse surrounding the standard of living, specifically focusing on the accessibility of essential food items. Through our collective efforts, we aim to make a positive impact on society, ensuring that the general public is equipped with the necessary information to make informed decisions and foster an environment where the availability of staple foods is optimized for the benefit of all.

To do this, they need you to prepare robust data bases in which it will be possible to see a comparison of food availability based on average incomes over a certain period of time.


As additional material, prepare a table with GDP, GINI coefficient and population of other European countries in the same period, as a primary overview for the Czech Republic.

=================================================================

Research questions

I.     Are wages rising in all industries over the years, or falling in some?

II.    How many liters of milk and kilograms of bread can be bought in the first and last comparable periods in the available price and wage data?

III.   Which food category is increasing in price the slowest (has the lowest percentage year-on-year increase)?

IV.    Has there been a year in which the year-on-year increase in food prices was significantly higher than wage growth (greater than 10%)?

V.     Does the level of GDP affect changes in wages and food prices? Or, if the GDP increases more significantly in one year, will this be reflected in food prices or wages in the same or the following year by a more significant increase?

==================================================================

Tips > Next, prepare a set of SQL, which will obtain the data base from the tables you have prepared to answer the set research questions. Be careful, the questions/hypotheses can support or refute your output! It depends on what the data says.
